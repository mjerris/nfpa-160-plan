# Appendix B: Validation Rules

Rules the system should enforce before allowing document generation and before allowing submission for review (Draft → Submitted transition). Artists can also run a "check completeness" action at any time to see which rules are not yet satisfied.

## Universal Validation

Applies to every submission regardless of installation type or fuel.

| At least one flame effect defined with classification | [5.3.2(4)] |
| SDS referenced (from global library) for every distinct fuel across all effects and performances | [5.3.2(6)] |
| Site plan includes all mandatory elements from [5.3.2(5)] | [5.3.2(5)] |
| Written operating instructions exist (start-up, show, shutdown, emergency) | [6.2.1] |
